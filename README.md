# Washup dashboard

## [Shiny App](http://sgbstats.shinyapps.io/washup22)

Welcome to my shiny app for the Didsbury LD washup, with all the data that is needed. 

The data is pulled from connect and matched using the pseudonymised Voter File VANID from Connect, no identifiable information is held in the app of the repo. The data is preprocessed on the local side and then an RDa file is saved for use in the shiny.The voting data has been taken from the marked register. 

### Tab 1: Basic Stats

Has the proportion of each ward or polling district.

### Tab 2:  Turnout

- Looks at how many people in each group turned out.

### Tab 3: Phantom Shuttle

- Looks at how many people were estimated to vote LD in each box and how many voters were from our shuttle.

### Tab 4: Turnover

- Looks at the date that people registered to vote and can be filtered by subgroups. 

### Tab 5: Sankey Diagram of turnout across elections

- Unfortunately we only have the register as it is at the end of the May election so it is looking at past history of voting/whether they were on the register.
